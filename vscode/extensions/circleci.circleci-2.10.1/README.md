The official CircleCI VS Code extension is a new way to interact with CircleCI.

This extension provides an interface to visualize and manage CircleCI pipelines
directly from your IDE, as well as providing contextual help when creating,
modifying and editing CircleCI YAML config files. This way, it avoids expensive
context-switching between VS Code and your browser.

More practically, this extension allows you to:

- Authenticate and connect VS Code to CircleCI
- Browse and interact with your pipelines. Available actions include
  - Viewing pipelines, workflows, and jobs statuses
  - Viewing test outputs
  - Browsing job logs
  - Downloading artifacts
  - Approving jobs
  - Re-running builds
  - Debugging jobs with SSH
- Be alerted through notifications when your workflows change status or need
  your attention
- Access in-file support when editing CircleCI YAML configuration files,
  including:
  - Syntax validation
  - Syntax highlighting
  - Go-to-definition and go-to-reference
  - On-hover documentation and usage hints
  - Autocompletion
- Launch commands to validate config files statically, or against your org
  policy

</div>

## Getting started

It’s easy to get started with CircleCI for VS Code.

1. **Install the extension**

   You can install the CircleCI extension from within VS Code, or download it
   from the marketplace.

   <div style="padding:10px; border-radius:2px; border: 1px solid #ffa700; font-weight: 500; margin-bottom: 10px;">⚠️ This extension is compatible with VS Code versions <code>1.85</code> or above.</div>

2. **Authenticate into CircleCI**

   Open the CircleCI Panel by clicking on the CircleCI icon on the activity bar
   on the left of your screen, then click on “Log in”.

      <div style="text-align:center">
       <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/il1yandlcjgk/1L7EbmIClXTEYvXo47vnW6/3b18d9b45b4ed84718f8c10d3cdc5e47/login_ui.png" alt="circleci-vscode-login" width="280"/>
   </div>

   You will be prompted to enter a
   [Personal API Token](https://app.circleci.com/settings/user/tokens). If you
   don't have one, you can generate a new one for this purpose.

   If you are an Enterprise customer, make sure to check the box and enter your
   self-hosted server URL.

3. **Setup your project**

   If your VS Code workspace contains one or more CircleCI projects, the
   extension will detect them automatically, and the Pipelines Panel will be
   populated with your most recent pipelines.

   If no project is detected, open the settings page (through the VS Code
   command `CircleCI: Open Settings`, or by clicking on the settings icon (⚙️)
   at the top of the Pipelines Panel), and select your projects manually.

   Please note that your manual selection will only be persisted if no projects
   are detected automatically.

      <div style="padding:10px; border-radius:2px; border: 1px solid #ffa700; font-weight: 500; margin-bottom: 10px;">⚠️ Automatic project detection does not work for GitLab projects. Please select your project manually from the Settings page.</div>

<!-- <div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/il1yandlcjgk/5zE2XGTqtWepwyExqSgT0x/5c035998c3d6d57add008da2470c7135/select-project-optimised.gif" alt="circleci-vscode-select-project" width="600"/>
</div> -->
<!-- TODO: Add a gif here?? -->

4. **Configure your Pipelines Panel**

   By default, your Pipelines Panel will display all the latest pipelines run on
   your project. However, you can configure it to show you only the pipelines
   you are interested in.

   All configurations are available in the Settings page, which you can open
   with the command `CircleCI: Open Settings` or by clicking on the settings
   icon (⚙️) at the top of the Pipelines Panel.

   Specifically, you can choose to follow:

   - Only your pipelines, or those authored by anyone
   - All branches, only your current branch, or a specific branch. You can also
     select the checkbox “Always display default branch”
   - Only pipelines that include workflows and jobs with specific _statuses_.

   <div style="text-align:center; padding:12px" >
       <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/il1yandlcjgk/6NiSdwwwEVB97zKgAja1DQ/dd33940b8a912aba8c6a2f80b56bd801/pipelines_settings.png" alt="circleci-vscode-pipelines-settings" width="450"/>
   </div>

5. **Configure notifications**

   You can set up pop-up notifications to warn you when a workflow in your
   Pipelines Panel has changed status.

    <div style="text-align:center">
      <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/il1yandlcjgk/7i88m699tJo30NHWT4eBgj/d2cd01431b1ff9f1e89fa74793a1521e/new_notification.png" alt="circleci-vscode-notification" width="320"/>
    </div>

   By default, you will receive a pop-up notification every time one of the
   workflows in your Pipelines Panel enters a failing status, or needs your
   approval.

   If you wish to alter these defaults, you can:

   - Mute notifications (a toggle button to change this setting is also
   available at the top of the Pipelines Panel)
   <!-- - Select to be notified only about pipelines you are the author of -->
   - Configure which workflow status changes you want to be notified about

   Please note that you can only be notified about workflows that appear in your
   Pipelines Panel.

    <div style="text-align:center; padding:12px">
        <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/il1yandlcjgk/4PUW1LkF5BAMI4l2x6AbNF/4c825c6a05b58623848e24ac7eb5f15e/notification_settings.png" alt="circleci-vscode-notifications-settings" width="450"/>
    </div>

## The Pipelines Panel

The Pipelines Panel lists all CircleCI projects detected in your workspace. For
each project, it shows the most recent pipelines, jobs and workflows, and lets
you monitor their status and interact with them.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/il1yandlcjgk/1wkgsoT4bLeu6um3jcVK6U/c5fc5cf811d3e6e75cc77a33d1425e95/pipelines_panel.png" alt="circleci-vscode-pipelines-panel" width="380"/>
</div>

For some tree objects, you can perform actions by clicking on the icons which
appear when you hover over the item.

### Project

Projects are the top level tree items, and they contain your pipelines.

<!-- Hovering over a Project lets you:
- Open in browser, to view the project in the CircleCI Web UI, applying the same filters currently active in the VS Code Pipelines Panel -->

If you don't follow a project, you can also use the panel to follow it.

### Pipeline

[Pipelines](https://circleci.com/docs/pipelines?utm_source=VS_Code_marketplace&utm_medium=marketplace&utm_campaign=CCI_VS_code_marketplace_page)
are nested under projects. They are the CircleCI unit of change, and they
contain your workflows.

<!-- Hovering over a Pipeline lets you:
- Open in browser, to view pipeline details in the CircleCI app on your default web browser -->

### Workflow

[Workflows](https://circleci.com/docs/workflows?utm_source=VS_Code_marketplace&utm_medium=marketplace&utm_campaign=CCI_VS_code_marketplace_page)
are nested under each Pipeline, and contain Jobs. Hovering over a Workflow lets
you:

- Open in browser, to view workflow details in the CircleCI app, on your default
  web browser
- Rerun workflow from start, to re-triggered the entire workflow
- Rerun workflow from failed, to re-triggered the workflow starting from the
  first failed job

### Job

[Jobs](https://circleci.com/docs/jobs-steps?utm_source=VS_Code_marketplace&utm_medium=marketplace&utm_campaign=CCI_VS_code_marketplace_page)
are nested under each Workflow, and can contain Tests and Artifacts. Hovering
over a Job lets you:

- Approve the job (only if the job is on hold)
- Cancel the job (only if the job is running)
- Rerun the job with SSH (you can read more about this functionality in a later
  section)
- **View job details**

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/il1yandlcjgk/XtreF3Lo54vkeBdjzZ4Ga/4a91c3cf47251cb4b3d76bc18cfec690/job-details-gif.gif" alt="circleci-job-details-webview" width="450"/>
</div>

By expanding a Job, you can also:

- **Load tests**, if you have configured your tests to upload test results to
  CircleCI. Tests that CircleCI has detected as flaky will be prefaced by the
  indication [FLAKY].
- **Load artifacts**, to load any artifacts created by the Job. Once the
  artifacts are loaded, you can download them by clicking on them.

### Re-run with SSH

You can re-run jobs with SSH directly from VS Code, either:

- through the Job Details page, by clicking on the green button on the top
  right:

<!-- <div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/il1yandlcjgk/4a7QIPEUXkD4UDEyacA8Y8/7e1ec72c8b799fbeb481b1b1503175b5/job-details.png" alt="rerun-with-ssh-inline" width="380"/>
</div> -->

- or by clicking on the action icon next to the job name in the Pipelines Panel.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/circleci/original/3X/1/f/1f0ee73a524c57191276a6ba66989892a317067a.png" alt="rerun-with-ssh-inline" width="300"/>
</div>

In both cases, you will be presented with two options:

1. **Open SSH session in terminal**

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/il1yandlcjgk/5Q5YsCydCIQqZDS8Dl3ePy/1126453a0088fef4572ca52335384c2e/ssh_terminal.png" alt="rerun-with-ssh-terminal" width="460"/>
</div>

2. **Open SSH session in remote VS Code window**

   > This feature requires the official VS Code extension
   > [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh).
   > You can find more information on Remote Development using SSH in VS Code
   > directly in the
   > [VS Code docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh).

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/il1yandlcjgk/PhAxalshH4WakKKx3eJAn/1f3351d12dd426878d1f3544172f496b/ssh_remote_window.png" alt="rerun-with-ssh-remote-window" width="460"/>
</div>

To rerun your job with SSH, you will first have to set the path to your Github
or Bitbucket SSH key. The first time you attempt to re-run with SSH, the
extension will guide you to select the path of the relevant SSH key. However, if
you miss this step or want to modify it at a later time, you can do so from the
dedicated section of the settings page:

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/il1yandlcjgk/5Bo33WhX9gG9CulAVVexPx/8267182255428dc28f2da6af51926eb7/ssh-settings.png" alt="circleci-vscode-ssh-settings" width="380"/>
</div>

If the job you want to rerun uses parallelism, you will be able to select which
job you want to SSH into.

> You can read more about debugging with SSH on CircleCI
> [in the Docs](https://circleci.com/docs/ssh-access-jobs/#ensure-the-correct-key-is-offered-to-circleci?utm_source=VS_Code_marketplace&utm_medium=marketplace&utm_campaign=CCI_VS_code_marketplace_page).

## Status Bar

The Status Bar provides summary information about the state of the CircleCI
extension, your project and your most recent workflow.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/il1yandlcjgk/2AxjT8oathUfD54twnPoJs/5899ed45f8961fc8f550f01cd84b53d3/status-bar.png" alt="circleci-vscode-status-bar" width="480"/>
</div>

Specifically, you might see the following statuses:

- **Not logged in** - when clicking on the status bar, the login page will open
- **No project** - when clicking on the status bar, the settings page will open
  so you can select a project manually
- **Success / On hold / Failed**, and similar workflow statuses - THIS refers to
  the status of the top pipeline in your panel. When clicking on the status bar,
  the relative workflow will come into focus on the CircleCI Pipelines Panel.
- **No internet** - when your internet connection is lost

## Config Helper

This extension provides in-file assistance with writing, editing and navigating
CircleCI Configuration files.

It is based on a CircleCI-specific Language Server, and offers:

- **Rich code navigation through “go-to-definition” and “go-to-reference”
  commands**. This is especially convenient when working on large configuration
  files, to verify the definition of custom jobs, executors parameters, or in
  turn view where any of them are referenced in the file. Assisted code
  navigation also works for Orbs, allowing to explore their definition directly
  in the IDE when using the go-to-definition feature on an orb-defined command
  or parameter.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/il1yandlcjgk/3JVSu8rTDQRJcIMGF866oJ/444091930e6c64dc9d52f17755e16af9/config_helper_go-to-definition-optimised.gif" alt="circleci-vscode-go-to-definition" width="380"/>
</div>

- **Contextual documentation and usage hints when hovering on specific keys**,
  so as to avoid having to continuously switch to the browser to check the docs
  whenever you are editing your YAML config. Links to the official CircleCI
  documentation are also provided on hover - for easier navigation.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/il1yandlcjgk/6bloAnI35jXou9Q91aGFgU/356b1554d42c77fb2708fac980a8d592/config_helper_on-hover-documentation.png" alt="circleci-vscode-documentation-on-hover" width="380"/>
</div>

- **Syntax validation** - which makes it much easier to identify typos,
  incorrect use of parameters, incomplete definitions, wrong types, invalid or
  deprecated machine versions, etc.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/il1yandlcjgk/1dF1ic2cUczaMYdxnSUZuF/fbc1eb5d5894a803caf297c57e808738/config_helper_syntax-validation.gif" alt="circleci-vscode-syntax-validation" width="380"/>
</div>

- **Usage warnings** - which can help identify deprecated parameters, unused
  jobs or executors, or missing keys that prevent you from taking advantage of
  CircleCI’s full capabilities

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/il1yandlcjgk/404bGppmtCgvE0WOmPk0E/0a92e373929d6d19c8f5a742f1097511/config_helper_usage-warning.png" alt="circleci-vscode-usage-warnings" width="380"/>
</div>

- **Auto completion**, available both on built-in keys and parameters and on
  user-defined variables

<div style="text-align:center;padding:12p">
    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/il1yandlcjgk/3jXaQvhOQgayhV9O4nfAhZ/b6d55e689ddfcf7673ab7e9b76ba0a53/config_helper_autocomplete.png" alt="circleci-vscode-autocomplete" width="380"/>
</div>

You can access a full overview of all errors, warnings and hints proposed by the
Config Helper in the Problems tab of VS Code.

## Config validation commands

The extension also provides two commands that help you statically validate your
YAML config files without having to run a pipeline.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/il1yandlcjgk/19bH6WVfybTjUb0037ARGq/54d0d24f8948894e3dac86dbeac4850b/config-validation-commands.png" alt="circleci-vscode-validation-commands" width="380"/>
</div>

1. **Validate current configuration file**

   Corresponds to the CLI command
   [`circleci config validate`](https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_config_validate.html),
   and verifies statically that the config file is well formed. Please note that
   this command only validates this file for structure and syntax errors, but
   not for semantic error (e.g. _this job does not exist_).

2. **Validate current configuration file against org policy**

   Corresponds to the CLI command
   [`circleci policy decide`](https://circleci-public.github.io/circleci-cli/circleci_policy_decide.html),
   and verifies that the configuration file complies with your organization
   policies - if any are set.

   > Please note that this command is only available to Scale customers

3. **View compiled version of current configuration file**

   This command resolves all orb references in your config file, and shows you
   the full-length version of your config.

All these commands can also be invoked:

- by right-clicking on a CircleCI YAML file:

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/il1yandlcjgk/11clc9xHtc83wdWtx3kgU7/01248678eb173688b371872ee4407d07/right-click-menu.png" alt="circleci-vscode-right-click-config-comands" width="480"/>
</div>

- by clicking on the CircleCI button on the top right corner of the page, when
  focusing on a CircleCI YAML file. Please note that the button will _not_ be
  visible if you are editing a different file.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/il1yandlcjgk/2jJdb6NkpYw2ytN1LgCl2V/e7c916cc0a0a332897bcb406044de8a4/cci-commands-gif.gif" alt="circleci-vscode-button-config-commands" width="480"/>
</div>

## 🆕 Test run your config (Open Preview)

> NOTE: The ability to trigger a pipeline from VS Code with a _unversioned_
> config is currently in Open Preview, and only available for projects
> integrated through the **GitHub OAuth app**, or **Bitbucket**. To find out
> which GitHub account type you have, see the
> [documentation about GitHub OAuth app integration](https://circleci.com/docs/github-integration/).

Trigger pipelines from VS Code to iterate on your CircleCI config without
committing your trial and error changes to your version control system. Run and
validate your full pipeline, or select jobs and workflows to validate
individually. View the results of your test runs in the Pipelines Panel or in
the CircleCI web app, just the same as any other pipeline.

![Config Test Run](https://images.ctfassets.net/il1yandlcjgk/3bAxTZDhAwAtvIMgLCmiPe/e65a39590bb65a3312fd5f7a76aef0e1/vscode-ext-config-test-run-crop.png 'CircleCI Config Test Run')

### Prerequisites

- `v2.0` or higher of the CircleCI VS Code extension
- A CircleCI account integrated through the GitHub OAuth app, or Bitbucket. To
  find out which GitHub account type you have, check
  [this docs page](https://circleci.com/docs/github-integration/).
- Your org must have opted-in to this feature through Organization Settings. You
  may need to ask your org admin to do so for you. See the section **Feature
  controls** below for more details.
- Your project must **not** make use of
  [dynamic configuration](https://circleci.com/docs/dynamic-config/). This
  feature is disabled for projects that use dynamic configuration.

NOTE: **Unversioned config** in CircleCI indicates that the
`.circleci/config.yml` on the branch where the pipeline is running is ignored,
and instead, the configuration file is overridden by a custom configuration file
passed as a parameter. The term “unversioned” refers to the fact the config file
is not versioned in the VCS. It is, however, stored in CircleCI along with the
pipeline, and it is available at any time in the CircleCI web app.

<div style="padding:10px; border-radius:2px; border: 1px solid #ffa700; font-weight: 500; margin-bottom: 10px;">
Please use caution when running pipelines with unversioned configuration, and take care to ensure no jobs with unintended effects are included in the run. For more details, see the section <b>Security Implications</b> below. 
</br>
Access to this feature is controlled by an opt-in setting which only organization admins can control. Once your organization has opted-in, you can opt-out for each individual project. For more details, see the section <b>Feature-controls</b> below.
</div>

### Steps

The following steps show how to test run a pipeline from the VS Code extension:

1. Open VS Code and select the CircleCI logo in the sidebar. The **Pipelines**
   and **Run** panels will be visible
2. Expand the **Run** panel to view your projects.
3. For each project, there is a button to trigger the config test run, and check
   boxes for each workflow and job for you to choose which parts of your config
   you want to run. Select your options, and click icon:play[]. Any local change
   you make to your `.circleci/config.yml` file will be included in the test
   run.
4. The pipeline is now visible in your dashboard in the CircleCI web app, at
   [app.circleci.com/pipelines/](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/), and the
   Pipelines Panel in the VS Code extension.

### Feature controls

The ability to trigger pipelines from VS Code can be controlled **at the org
level** and **at the project level**.

- **<u>Opt-in</u> organization level setting**. This can be changed only by
  organization admins, and overrides project settings.

  Setting location:
  `Organization Settings > Advanced > Allow triggering pipelines with unversioned config`
  in the [Web App](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines).

- **<u>Opt-out</u> project level setting**.

  Setting location:
  `Project Settings > VS Code integration > Allow triggering pipelines with unversioned config`
  in the [Web App](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines).

## Security Implications

Running pipelines with unversioned config can cause security vulnerabilities.
Before enabling this feature, please acknowledge the risks outlined in the
[official Docs](https://circleci.com/docs/vs-code-extension-overview/#security-implications).

---

## Troubleshooting

Here are some frequently encountered issues, and some clarifications on each of
them.

- `“Your project could not be detected because no workspace is currently open”`

  You can fix this issue by opening a folder or workspace. Alternatively, you
  can select to follow a CircleCI project manually from the Settings page.

- The following errors concern the ability of the extension to link your
  workspace to a Git repository.

  - `“Your project could not be detected because we couldn’t find a Git repository associated with this workspace”`
  - `“Your project could not be detected because we were unable to get the list of git remotes”`
  - `“Your project could not be detected because we could not find default remote of your Git repository”`
  - `“Your project could not be detected because we were unable to get the URL of the Git remote XYZ”`

  When any of these errors occur, you might want to check that your workspace
  has a valid Git remote URL. You can also fix this issue by selecting to follow
  a CircleCI project manually from the Settings page.

- `“Your project could not be detected because CircleCI does not know this project”`

  This error indicates that the repository associated with your workspace
  doesn’t appear to be a CircleCI project. If this is unexpected, verify the Git
  remote URL associated with your repository, and ensure that you see this
  project on the CircleCI web app. You can also address this issue by selecting
  to follow a CircleCI project manually from the Settings page.

- `“Your project could not be detected because you don't follow this project on CircleCI”`

  When you see this error, you might want to visit the
  [Projects page on the CircleCI app](https://app.circleci.com/projects/project-dashboard/github/)
  and ensure that you “follow” the project associated with this workspace.

- `“connection to server is erroring. Shutting down server”`

  This message indicates that the CircleCI Language Server has crashed. This
  might be caused by an unexpected parsing error. For this reason, it is likely
  that this issue will always occur on the same file. If you identify a file
  that causes this error, it would be helpful if you could inform us at XXXXXX
  (in the future on the LS open source repo)

- When interacting with pipelines, workflows and jobs, you might see the
  following errors.

  - `“Cannot refresh pipelines: [runtime error message]”`
  - `“Download failed [runtime error message”’`
  - `“Cannot rerun workflow because: [runtime error message]”`
  - `“Job approval failed: [runtime error message]”`

  Please keep in mind that one of the causes for any of the above error messages
  could be network issues. If you see any of these messages repeatedly, we
  recommend you check your internet connection.

- The following errors should never occur. Should you see any of them and be
  able to reproduce them appearing, it would be helpful if you could report this
  to us.
  - `“Target entity can not be cancelled because it is not a workflow / job”`
  - `“Your project is not set up”`
  - `“Can not cancel your job because it has no job number”`
